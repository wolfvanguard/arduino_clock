# Arduino Uno Alarm clock
This is a short project leveraging the skills of embedded systems development.

Title: Arduino Uno Work Alarm

Project Owner and Developer: @Keertikumar Kubareea 

Project High level description:

Upon powering up the device, an LCD display will prompt the user to push a desired buttons from a list of buttons. 

There will a total of 4 buttons:

Start work timer - ideally 2 hours before first break. Then automatically switches to break mode for 15 mins before entering the second 2 hour deep work session. 

Start book reading timer - 45 mins of deep read session then timer ends

Start a game timer - 2 hours maximum. Timer continues after exceeding 2 hours and displays an angry message to say stop wasting time on games until a stop timer button is pressed

Start morning meditation timer - short 20 minutes timer for meditation that will display a loop display on the LCD for the meditator to focus on while also focusing on deep breathing and having appreciative thoughts. After the 20 mins - LCD displays a message to pray to god before ending the session with a stop session button

 

Goals:

Show embedded systems programming skills

Show the ability for incremental program development

Show schematics drawing skills 

Sequence diagram drawing skills

Develop a self development tool that will help people to set a time frame for working, relaxing and meditating 

Required equipment:

Arduino UNO (Kuman UNO)
